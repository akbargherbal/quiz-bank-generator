# Quiz Bank Generation Request (Focused Flavor)

## Goal

Generate a **new batch** of multiple-choice quiz questions based on the codebase previously analyzed. This request builds upon our prior interaction; **do not re-analyze the entire codebase** or repeat previously generated questions.

## Instructions

1.  **Leverage Previous Analysis:** Use your existing understanding of the concepts, libraries, and patterns present in the codebase provided in our initial interaction.
2.  **Apply Focused Flavor:** For this new batch, please give **some preferential focus** to questions related to the **Focus Areas listed below**. The overall set of questions generated should have a noticeable, but not exclusive, slant towards these topics combined, exploring their relevant aspects as found within the analyzed codebase.
3.  **Ensure Diversity and Balance:** While giving emphasis to the **Focus Areas listed below**, it is crucial that you **also generate a good variety of questions covering other significant concepts and patterns** identified across the codebase. The aim is to produce a well-rounded quiz bank with a specific flavor, not one solely dedicated to the emphasized topics. Ensure a balanced representation reflecting the different facets of the project's code.
4.  **Adhere to Format:** Generate the new quiz items using the **exact same XML format** as specified previously:
    *   Root element: `<QUIZ_BANK>` (with *no* attributes).
    *   Each question within a `<QUIZ_ITEM>`.
    *   Elements within `<QUIZ_ITEM>`: `<QUESTION>`, `<OPTION1 correct="true">`, `<OPTION2 correct="false">`, `<OPTION3 correct="false">`, `<OPTION4 correct="false">`, `<OPTION5 correct="false">`, `<TOPIC>`, `<TAG>`, `<PATH>`.
    *   Exactly 5 options per question, `OPTION1` is always correct.
    *   Include the relevant `<PATH>` tag linking to the source file for *every* question.
5.  **Question Content Rules:** Remember to focus on *general conceptual understanding* relevant to the codebase, not implementation specifics tied only to the file in `<PATH>`. Keep code snippets in `<QUESTION>` concise and avoid code in `<OPTION>` tags.
6.  **Quantity:** Generate a reasonable number of high-quality, distinct questions for this batch, appropriate for covering the emphasized topics while maintaining the required diversity.

## Output

Provide **only** the newly generated `<QUIZ_BANK>` containing the new `<QUIZ_ITEM>` elements, adhering strictly to the specified XML structure.
